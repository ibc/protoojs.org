# Overview

Protoo is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) signaling framework for building Real-Time Communication applications. Its primary purpose is to provide existing Web applications with chat, presence and audio&video calls capabilities, although Protoo's scope is not limited to just that.

Protoo defines a signaling protocol based on JSON requests and responses. It is up to the application to define and extend the signaling protocol and the content of requests and responses in order to accomplish the desired feature set.

Protoo integrates well with Node HTTP frameworks such as [Express](http://expressjs.com/). It can also be run as a standalone server.
